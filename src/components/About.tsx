      I am a dedicated and passionate developer with a growing skill set in both programming and web development. My journey in tech started with a strong foundation from my studies at <b>"M.Shafi Educational Complex"</b>. Beginning with languages like C, C++ and Java, I am now expanding into modern web frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world projects. Whether I am working on web applications, exploring mobile development with Flutter, or enhancing my problem-solving skills, I am always eager to learn and grow.
